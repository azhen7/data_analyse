# ISU Artifact 2

This project is a web service written in HTML and JavaScript designed, developed, and tested by Adam Zheng, a Gr. 9 student in the pre-IB program at Merivale High School, used to plot and analyze single-variable data, bivariate data, and multivariate data. This project is to be submitted to Mr. Sadaphal at Merivale High School.

This project uses [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) (to generate the graphs) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

## How To Install
First, create a new folder. Then, clone this GitHub repository into the folder: <br>
`git clone https://github.com/azhen7/data_analyse.git`

You should now see a subfolder named `data_analyse`. Type `cd data_analyse` into the terminal.

Once the current directory is `data_analyse`, install [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/): <br>
`npm install --save electron`.

Everything should now be in place! Just type `npm start` into the terminal and the app should start!
