# ISU Artifact 2

This project is a web service written in HTML and JavaScript designed, developed, and tested by Adam Zheng, a Gr. 9 student in the pre-IB program at Merivale High School, used to plot and analyze single-variable data, bivariate data, and multivariate data. This project is to be submitted to Mr. Sadaphal at Merivale High School.

This project uses [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) (to generate the graphs) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
